## What is Progressive Enhancement?

Progressive enhancement is a web development technique that focuses on using the
**web platform**'s core features to build resilient and accessible web applications, and then *progressively enhance* the experience by adding feedback, animations, and other client-side features.

Do you recall how the native `form` element works? When you submit a form, the browser will send a request to the server, and the server will respond with a new HTML page.

```html
<form>
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <input type="password" name="password" />
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

Yes, the browser already knows how to send data to the server and show the new
page. If you are using any modern JavaScript framework, you probably forgot **how
forms work**.

With modern JavaScript frameworks, we intercept the form submission, prevent the
browser's default behaviour, and use the `fetch` API to send the form data to the server.
Then, we use the response to update the DOM using JavaScript.

```tsx
export default function Todos() {
  function handleCreateTodo(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    const formData = new FormData(event.target);

    try {
      const res = await fetch('/api/todo', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData,
      });
      const data = await res.json();
      // Do something with the data
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle error
    }
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleCreateTodo}>
      <input type="text" name="title" />
      <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

**We are not taking advantage of the web platform**. If the user doesn't have
JavaScript – and there are many reasons why they might not (*we'll get to that
later*) – then he would not be able to use our application.

If your website is a single-page application, and is not being server-side rendered, that user will not be able to see the content of your website.

That's why I think *progressive enhancement* is so important. The very basic
functionality of your website **should be available** to everyone, regardless of
their device, browser, or internet connection.

This users will not have the best experience, but at least they will be able to use your website.

And then, using JavaScript, we can *enhance* the experience for the rest of the
users, providing them with a more interactive and engaging experience.

But why is this important? Everyone has JavaScript, right?


## But Everyone Has JavaScript, Right?

Well, [not really](https://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html). There are many reasons why a user might not have JavaScript.

- All your users are non-JS while they're downloading your JS.

- If your users are on a train and their net connection goes away before your
  JavaScript loads, then there's no JavaScript.

- Some corporate firewalls block JavaScript.

- Some ISPs or mobile operators interfere with JavaScript, and if you've never
  experienced this before, drive to an airport and use their WiFi.

- Microbrowsers are everywhere, and they won't wait for your client app to boot up.

- Some users have JavaScript disabled.

- There are thousands of browser extensions that might interfere with your
  JavaScript.

- Your CDN might be down, making your whole app unusable.

- Some users have a browser that doesn't support JavaScript.

- Some users have a slow connection.


This concept of *progressive enhancement* might sound strange to you, but it's
actually how the web was designed to work, and you might be using it without
even knowing it.


## You Are Already Using Progressive Enhancement

If you are using any JavaScript framework like [Next](https://nextjs.org/),
[Remix](https://remix.run/) or [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), you are probably using *progressive enhancement*.

Components like Next's or Remix's `<Link>` will work like a regular `<a>`
element while JavaScript is not loaded, and will be enhanced when JavaScript is
loaded.

While there is no JavaScript, it will work just like a regular link, triggering a full
page reload to show the new HTML page.

But then, if JavaScript is loaded, this component will intercept the click
event, fetch the new page, update the DOM, and change the URL without refreshing the page.

That is a great example of *progressive enhancement*. The **basic
functionality** is available to everyone, and then it is *enhanced* with
JavaScript. In this case, this *"enhancement"* is navigating without a page
refresh and preserving client state, prefetching, etc.

You might think this is a rare case, that only a few users will notice. Is it really worth the effort?


## Progressive Enhancement And Accessibility

My take here, is that you should think about *progressive enhancement* very
similarly to how you think about *accessibility*.

We live in a world where building products that provide **value** is the top
priority, and if something doesn't, since it only affects a small percentage of
users, spending time and effort on it is not worth it.
 
But if we had libraries and tools that help us make our sites accessible without
much effort, why wouldn't we use them?

That's why libraries like [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) or [Headless
UI](https://headlessui.com/) are so useful. They help us build fully accessible
web apps without the hassle.

```tsx
import * as DropdownMenu from "@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu";

export default function MyAccessibleDropdown() {
  return (
    <DropdownMenu.Root>
      <DropdownMenu.Trigger>
        <Button variant="soft">
          Options
          <CaretDownIcon />
        </Button>
      </DropdownMenu.Trigger>
      <DropdownMenu.Content>
        <DropdownMenu.Item shortcut="⌘ E">Edit</DropdownMenu.Item>
        <DropdownMenu.Item shortcut="⌘ D">Duplicate</DropdownMenu.Item>
        <DropdownMenu.Separator />

        <DropdownMenu.Sub>
          <DropdownMenu.SubTrigger>More</DropdownMenu.SubTrigger>
          <DropdownMenu.SubContent>
            <DropdownMenu.Item>Move to project…</DropdownMenu.Item>
            <DropdownMenu.Item>Move to folder…</DropdownMenu.Item>
          </DropdownMenu.SubContent>
        </DropdownMenu.Sub>

        <DropdownMenu.Separator />
        <DropdownMenu.Item shortcut="⌘ ⌫" color="red">
          Delete
        </DropdownMenu.Item>
      </DropdownMenu.Content>
    </DropdownMenu.Root>
  )
}
```

And the same goes for *progressive enhancement*. If the frameworks give us **good
defaults**, and build on top of the **web platform**, we can improve the resilience
and availability of our applications without having to change the way we
develop.

Now, let's see an example of how we can achieve this.


## A Real World Example

In this example we will use [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), but there are
other frameworks that have similar patterns, like [Remix](https://remix.run).

```svelte
<form method="POST" action="?/create">
	<label>
    Title:
		<input
			name="title"
			autocomplete="off"
			required
		/>
	</label>
  <button type="submit">Create Todo</button>
</form>
```

This is just a regular form. When the user submits the form, the browser will
send a request to the server, and the server will respond with a new HTML page.

We have a server `action` that will handle the form submission. Don't worry
about the details of this function, just know that it will create a new todo in
the database.

```ts
import type { Actions } from './$types';

export const actions = {
  create: async ({ request }) => {
    const data = await request.formData();

    try {
      db.todos.create(data.get('title'));
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        status: 400,
        body: { error: error.message },
      };
    }
  }
} satisfies Actions;
```

Our app works even if the user doesn't have JavaScript. That's great, because
it means our app is **resilient** and available to everyone.

Now, we can *progressively enhance* the experience by adding some client-side
interactivity. In this case, we will use SvelteKit's `use:enhance` directive,
which will emulate the browser-native behaviour, but without the full-page
reload. It will:

- Update the `form` prop.

- Invalidate all data on a successful response, causing `load` functions to
  re-run.

- Navigate to the new page on a redirect response.

- Render the nearest error page if an error occurs.

And we can add things like **pending states**, **animations**, and **optimistic
UI**.

```svelte {2,3,8,14-21,26,35-37}
<script lang="ts">
  import { fly, slide } from 'svelte/transition';
  import { enhance } from '$app/forms';
  import type { PageData } from './$types';

  export let data: PageData;

  let creating = false;
</script>

<form 
  method="POST"
  action="?/create"
  use:enhance={() => {
    creating = true;

    return async ({ update }) => {
      await update();
      creating = false;
    };
  }}
>
	<label>
    Title:
		<input
      disabled={creating}
			name="title"
			autocomplete="off"
			required
		/>
	</label>
  <button type="submit">Create Todo</button>
</form>

{#if creating}
  <p>Creating todo...</p>
{/if}

<ul>
  {#each data.todos as todo (todo.id)}
    <li in:fly={{ y: 20 }} out:slide>
      {todo.title}
    </li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

Our app now is fully **interactive**, but it still works without JavaScript. That's
the power of *progressive enhancement*. We didn't need to implement crazy behaviours
to make this work. We just used the web platform's core features, paired with a
good framework, to build a resilient and accessible web application.


## Conclusion

This fancy term of *progressive enhancement* is not new, it's just how the web was
designed to work. I think we should take advantage of the web platform and build
on top of it, with the help of frameworks and libraries that give us the right tools
to do so.
