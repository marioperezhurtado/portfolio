As a frontend/fullstack TypeScript developer, I wanted to explore a completely different language, stepping out of my comfort zone and exploring new ways of doing things.

Rust’s selling point for a large group of people is its performance, but I was particularly interested in its _error handling_ and _functional language_ features. I found much more than I expected on my journey.

I am far from being an expert in Rust, but I would like to discuss the topics that have caught my interest the most, changing my perspective on software development.

### Inmutability By Default

In Rust, variables are immutable by default. To declare a variable as mutable, you must use the `mut` keyword. Functions also need to declare if they intend to mutate their arguments.

This means that we must be very **explicit** about whether we are going to change the value of any variable, making our code more robust and predictable, and easier to reason about.

```rust
let foo = 5;
let mut bar = 10;  // `bar` is mutable

show(&foo);
increment(&mut bar);  // takes a mutable reference to `bar`

let fizz = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
let mut buzz = vec![5, 6, 7, 8];

fizz.push(10)  // ✗
buzz.push(20)  // ✔
```

### Pattern Matching

Rust's _pattern matching_ syntax is a powerful tool for handling complex data types and writing robust and expressive code.

Cosider a program that represents the types of US coins. We can use an enum to represent the different types of coins, and another one to represent all the possible states of the quarter coins:

```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // ...
}
```

We could write a function that takes an unknown US coin, determines which coin it is, and returns its value in cents.

Let’s imagine that a friend is trying to collect all 50 state quarters. While we sort our loose change by coin type, we’ll also call out the name of the state associated with each quarter so that if it’s one our friend doesn’t have, they can add it to their collection.

```rust
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
            25
        }
    }
}
```

The `match` statement allow us to compare a value against a series of _patterns_ and then execute code based on which pattern matches. We can represent all the possible states of our application and safely handle every scenario in a concise and expressive way.

The following example is taken from my solution for [Advent of Code 2022 - Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2). We won't cover the entire problem here, but the code below calculates the score of a given round of "Rock Paper Scissors".

1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors.

0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won.

The first `match` expression evaluates a tuple of the player’s and oponent’s chosen shapes. The second one evaluates the outcomes of the round and adds a bonus to the score.

```rust
fn round_score(shape_player: Shape, shape_oponent: Shape) -> u32 {
    let round_result = match (shape_player, shape_oponent) {
        (Shape::Rock, Shape::Scissors) => Outcome::Win(1),
        (Shape::Rock, Shape::Rock) => Outcome::Draw(1),
        (Shape::Rock, Shape::Paper) => Outcome::Loss(1),
        (Shape::Paper, Shape::Rock) => Outcome::Win(2),
        (Shape::Paper, Shape::Paper) => Outcome::Draw(2)
        (Shape::Paper, Shape::Rock) => Outcome::Loss(2),
        (Shape::Scissors, Shape::Paper) => Outcome::Win(3),
        (Shape::Scissors, Shape::Scissors) => Outcome::Draw(3)
        (Shape::Scissors, Shape::Rock) => Outcome::Loss(3),
    }

    match round_result {
        Outcome::Win(val) => val + 6,
        Outcome::Draw(val) => val + 3,
        Outcome::Lose(val) => val,
    }
}
```

The important bit here, is that pattern matching is _exhaustive_, wich means we must handle all possible cases eliminating the risk of missing critical scenarios and potential bugs.

Otherwise, the program would not compile:

```
~$ cargo run
   Compiling advent-of-code-2022 v0.1.0 (/advent-of-code-2022)
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `(Shape::Rock, Shape::Scissors)` not covered

```

### Error Handling Done Right

Rust treats errors as values. Instead of _throwing_ and error and hoping that some function above will _catch_ it, if your code can produce an error, the compiler requires you to handle it or explicitly pass it to the next function. `Result` is an enum that can be either `Ok` or `Err`. Each variant represents the success or failure of the operation, with its resulting value.

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

Consider this code that reads from a text file. The `read_to_string` function has a return type of `Result`. That indicates that the code may contain an error, and requires handling it before using the result.

```rust
use std::fs;

fn read_from_file(path: &str) {
    let read_result = fs::read_to_string(path);

    match read_result {
        Ok(content) => println!("Nice! {}", content),
        Err(error) => println!("Oops! {}", error),
    }
}
```

If we do not want to handle it now, we must modify the function signature to indicate that the result of this function could potentially be an error.

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io::Error;

fn read_from_file(path: &str) -> Result<String, Error> {
    let read_result = fs::read_to_string(path);

    read_result
}
```

By combining _errors as values_ with enums and pattern matching, Rust ensures that we correctly handle all possible errors in our code.

```rust
match error.kind() {
    ErrorKind::NotFound => do_something(),
    ErrorKind::PermissionDenied => do_something(),
    ErrorKind::FileTooLarge => do_something(),
    // ...
    _ => do_something(),  // catch-all
}
```

Comparing it to TypeScript, we can see the strength of this solution. In TypeScript, errors are thrown without any built-in mechanism to ensure that all error scenarios are properly handled or even if they will be handled at all. In addition, TypeScript does not allow overloading the catch method to handle different error types as other languages do.

```tsx
try {
  // do i need to try catch?
  does_this_throw()
} catch (err: ???) {} // cannot infer the possible error types

// cannot overload with multiple catches
// who is responsible for handling?
```

### Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake

The problem with _null values_ is that if you try to use a null value as a not-null value, you will get an error of some kind. Because this null or not-null property is pervasive, it’s extremely easy to make this kind of error.

In his 2009 presentation “Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,” Tony Hoare, the inventor of null, has this to say:

> I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented language. My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn’t resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.
> — <cite>Tony Hoare</cite>

The problem isn’t really with the concept of null values, but with the particular implementation. As such, Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an _enum_ that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent.

`Option` is an enum that encodes the very common scenario in which a value could be something or it could be nothing. A `Option` type can be either `Some`, with a value, or `None`, that represents the absence of a value.

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

The Rust compiler ensures that you convert an `Option<T>` to a `T` before you can perform `T` operations with it. Generally, this helps catch one of the most common issues with null: assuming that something isn’t null when it actually is.

```rust
fn find(haystack: &str, needle: char) -> Option<usize> {
    for (index, c) in haystack.char_indices() {
        if c == needle {
            return Some(index);  // we've found the index of the needle!
        }
    }
    None  // we didn't found it, there is no index to return
}

fn main() {
    let result = find("hello", 'l');
    match result {
        Some(index) => println!("Found at index {}", index),
        None => println!("Not found"),
    }
}
```

### Rust Compiler Teaches You

Learning Rust can be challenging. At first, understanding concepts such as the ownership model, string types, generics, traits, lifetimes, macros, and complying with the strict and authoritative rules of the language, can be overwhelming. However, one thing that made my learning journey easier was to learn from the compiler errors.

Initially, you may make several fundamental mistakes because you do not yet understand how Rust works. The compiler is very strict, but it is also extremely useful, showing precisely where the error occurred, the probable solution to it, and a brief explanation along with the corresponding error code.

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
  --> src/main.rs:18:5
   |
16 |     let word = first_word(&s);
   |                           -- immutable borrow occurs here
17 |
18 |     s.clear(); // error!
   |     ^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
19 |
20 |     println!("the first word is: {}", word);
   |                                       ---- immutable borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`.
error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error
```

### Conclusion

Learning Rust can be challenging, but it's worth the effort. Rust is a strict language with a steep learning curve; however, this design choice helps developers understand its complexity early on and avoid bugs in the future. Keep this in mind before starting your Rust learning journey.

All the topics we have discussed, and many more advanced features that I have yet to learn, make Rust a robust, elegant, and powerful language. Although I will probably not use it at work, I have found it a very enjoyable language. It has changed my view on software development and how things can be done in many different ways, and most importantly, it has been _really fun_.🦀
