As developers, we often enjoy talking about our favorite tools and technologies.
Some of us tend to care about certain topics that we think are more important
than they actually are. 

And that is fine, as long as you recognize we are just a bunch of nerds, arguing about our favorite way of typing characters on a keyboard to build stuff. The importance resides on the product itself.

## Your Framework Is Fine

Use React? Great. Prefer Vue? Excellent. Enjoy Angular? Okay. Like Laravel? Good. Opted for WordPress? Nice. C# is your thing? Cool.

**Use whatever you are comfortable and productive with.** At the end of the day, the technology you use, with its advantages and disadvantages, is not the biggest of your problems.

Don't get me wrong, you absolutely should care about how you develop your applications, but don't get too attached to it, nor think it's the *only way* to do it. **You can build good stuff with pretty much any technology.**

Have you ever search for a recipe on your phone?

After accepting cookies, closing multiple modals, popups, rejecting to sign up
for the newsletter, skipping ads, and trying to find where the hell is that 5 step recipe for a meat pie you were looking for, have you ever thought:  *"Hmm, I hope this site used Vue instead of WordPress"* ?

**I don't think so.** We've all experienced what *really* sucks about the Web.

## Cookie Banners

Privacy is important, I get it. But it this really the best way to enforce fair
privacy policies?

What percentage of users actually read the cookie policy?

How many websites store your cookies anyway, or are not GDPR compliant? Many government sites are not.

Do users really care, or even understand this?

Wasn't really a way to make this a configuration option in your browser? Did anyone
thought about how to enforce better privacy policies without annoying the users
that just don't care all over the web? At least we should keep trying to find
a better way.

I don't infer bad intentions from EU regulators to try to protect users privacy,
but a highly dubious outcome.

## Popups And Invasive Advertising

After closing that annoying cookie banner, you are now ready to read that article you were looking for, right?

**Wrong.** You have to close the popup that asks you to subscribe to the newsletter.
Also close that *“special offer”* popup that is blocking the content. Maybe some ads covering a third of the screen. Now you can read the article, if you can find it while the content is shifting around.

This is not a good experience. I understand that many sites need to generate
revenue to be able to create this content, but when it is done in an invasive
way – and that's very common – the result is **extremely repulsive**.

If you install an app, you probably already know exactly what it is, and knowingly went to download it. It is not a surprise that the app asks for some permissions, accept their terms, create an account, etc.

The Web is different, it's meant to be **explored**, to constantly be visiting new
sites. It is very likely that a user lands on your site for the first time.

If their first experience is being bombarded with popups and modals that prevent
them from finding the content they were looking for, or their screen is covered
with ads, you can imagine how they will feel about your site.

## Mobile (Un)Friendly

Most people browse the web from their phones. This may apply more or less depending on the kind of site you are building, but everyone knows it's important to adapt your layout for mobile devices. Some developers even prefer a *mobile-first* approach. But adapting your layout is **not enough.**

You should also adapt the *usability* of your site. Certain flows that work on desktop are not intuitive on mobile.

Another example of mobile *unfriendliness* is how many apps don't persist
important state to the **URL**, and this specially becomes a problem for mobile
navigation, because then you cannot simply press the back button (or swipe) to go back.

Popups, modals, and invasive ads are even more frustrating on mobile. Having lots of ads in a small screen, trying to close popups with your fat thumbs, and having a lot more vertical scrolling while the content shifts around it's much more annoying than on desktop.

## Good Forms Are Rare

Since I was a kid and just started using the Internet, I've experienced what I thought was the root of all evil: **bad forms**. Somehow, it still happens nowadays. I'm sure you have experienced it too.

You fill a cramped and confusing form, with little to no feedback. You submit it, but you get an error. 

The form was completely reset, and you have to fill everything again. **Ugh.**

After filling it again, you get another error that didn't show up before.

Sometimes it doesn't even tell you exactly what is wrong. And you just keep trying while getting more frustrated.

Forms with good (or even decent) user experience are hard to find, even though they are the **foundation of the Web.**
