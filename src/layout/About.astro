        I've always been trying different areas that have interested me over the
        years, such as graphic design or video editing. 🎬
      </p>
      <p class="mb-5 sm:mb-10">
        At some point, I discovered that I could create simple websites for free
        and in a <Highlighted text="hands-on" /> way. I was amazed by the possibilities
        that the web offered, and I started playing around and exploring.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-5 sm:mb-10">
        I discovered a world that I was passionate about, and that I only needed
        dedication and hard work to become a professional. ⏳
      </p>
      <p class="mb-5 sm:mb-10">
        Since then, I've continued (and will continue) learning different
        technologies and growing as a developer. I keep on this path,
        <Highlighted text="building things," /> and enjoying my journey.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-5 sm:mb-10">
        Now, I am looking forward to start my career and add value to real
        production projects, building beautiful interfaces and great user
        experiences. 🚀
