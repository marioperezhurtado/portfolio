    A glimpse into myself

      I've always been trying different areas that have interested me over the
      years, such as graphic design or video editing. 🎬
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5 sm:mb-10">
      At some point, I discovered that I could create simple websites for free
      and in a <Highlighted text="practical" /> way. I was amazed by the possibilities
      that the web offered, and I started playing around and exploring.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5 sm:mb-10">
      I discovered a world that I was passionate about, and that I only needed
      dedication and hard work to became a professional. ⏳
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5 sm:mb-10">
      Since then, I've continued (and will continue) learning different
      technologies and growing as a developer. I keep on that path,
      <Highlighted text="building things" />, and enjoying my journey.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5 sm:mb-10">
      Now, I am looking forward to start my career and add value to real
      production projects, building beautiful interfaces and great user
      experiences. 🚀
